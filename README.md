Benchmarking qpu:ascella with 4-photon examples

Example Nº1: 4-photon interference

Implement a universal method to measure the genuine indistinguishability of 4 photons. This is generazible to n photons. This example is based on the work published by M. Pont et al. in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.031033. 

Example Nº2: Generation and characterisation of a 4-photon GHZ state

Generates a 4-photon Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with a photonic circuit. Computes the stabilizer witness for GHZ states, and a lower bound for the fidelity of the generated state to the target state. This example is based on the work published by M. Pont et al. in https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15626.
